Hello! If you are looking at this, it means you are interested in the automoving items program!
So, ill give you the setup for it.


1. Place down a computer (Universal across all setups. You can use the same computer for multiple programs.)            ] THESE STEPS ARE PRETTY MUCH UNIVERSAL    
2. use Wget OR install the .lua file from this repository and drag and drop it into ComputerCraft.                      ]
The program will download as the file name if you use drag and drop. (Drag in Mining.lua and it imports as Mining.lua)  ]
3. Put the name of the program into the terminal                                                                        ]

PROGRAM UNIQUE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
1. Upon entering the program, it will ask you for an item name. Input the item name like this: <modname>:<itemname>, ex. minecraft:stick. 
These are the same as you would use in /give. After inputting item name, press Enter.
2. Now, it will ask you for a destination. If you do not know how these work, do the following substeps.
2a. Place down a wired modem next to any inventory block.
2b. Activate the wired modem. It will give out the ID of the item in chat, such as minecraft:chest_68, or create:item_vault_110
2c. Put these into the computer. You can have multiple destinations by doing: minecraft:chest_60,create:item_vault_10,create:depot_134,etc,etc,etc.
3. Then, do the same thing for Sources. (Where the modems will pull from.)
4. Press enter, and it should start automoving.


HOW TO CONFIGURE YOUR STARTUP TO BE FOR THIS ONE PROGRAM! Replace <YOUR PROGRAM NAME> with the downloaded programs name, such as: shell.run("Miner.lua")
sleep(0.1)
shell.run("<YOUR PROGRAM NAME>"



KNOWN ISSUES:
Sometimes if you have it run on startup without a delay, it gives an error when using Sophisticated backpacks. The fix is to have a slight sleep in the startup command, as shown above.
